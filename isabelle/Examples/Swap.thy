section \<open>Simple Swap\<close>

text \<open>
A simple swap contract consists on two parties exchanging some \<^term>\<open>amount\<close> of \<^term>\<open>Token\<close>s
atomically. Each participant needs to deposit their tokens into the contract by a certain
\<^term>\<open>depositDeadline\<close>. If they do, the contract makes the swap and pays the participants, if
one of the participant fails to make the deposit, the funds held by the contract can be redeemed
by the owner.

\<comment> \<open>Another lemma to add would be: If d2 < d1, and the first deposit is made before d1 but after d2, then the second deposit can never be made.\<close>
\<comment> \<open>Another lemma to make would be around negative amounts, to show that they give warnings. Maybe show that if amounts are positive and d2 > d1 there can never be a warning?\<close>
