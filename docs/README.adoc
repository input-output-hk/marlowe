== Learning about Marlowe and the Marlowe Playground

Marlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing financial
contracts that run on blockchain.

The best place to go to learn about Marlowe and to try it out is the https://play.marlowe-finance.io/[Marlowe Playground], which also contains a https://play.marlowe-finance.io/doc/marlowe/tutorials/index.html[tutorial] about Marlowe.

== Earlier versions of Marlowe

This document describes the different materials available for learning
about Marlowe and the online tool that accompanies it: the Marlowe
Playground. originally called Meadow. It also advises you where to
begin, depending on what you want to learn, and where you are starting
from.

Marlowe is realised as DSL embedded in Haskell, but it is possible to
use Marlowe without being a Haskell expert. Marlowe is a live project,
and the materials here describe two versions of Marlowe: the earlier
https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/tree/v1.3[version 1.3], and
the
https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/tree/master/semantics-2.0[current
version], 2.0.

The Marlowe Playground is also available in two versions:

* It was originally called
https://input-output-hk.github.io/marlowe/[Meadow] supports v1.3, and
this version supports contract development using Blockly, a visual
programming environment. It also supports the development of
``embedded'' contracts using aspects of Haskell, but because this runs a
Haskell environment in the browser, it has a substantial latency.
* The latest version, the https://prod.meadow.marlowe.iohkdev.io[Marlowe
Playground], supports development of embedded contracts is a much more
efficient way, as well as presenting a substantially cleaner interface,
but doesn’t currently support visual program development.

=== Where should I start?

I want to learn the ideas behind Marlowe, but not to write Marlowe
contracts myself.

* The first parts of the link:./tutorial-v1.3/README.md[tutorial] and
the https://www.udemy.com/marlowe-programming-language/[Udemy course]
will give you this introduction.

I want to learn how to write simple Marlowe contracts, and to run them
in the Meadow tool.

* The https://www.udemy.com/marlowe-programming-language/[Udemy course]
and link:./tutorial-v1.3/README.md[tutorial] will give you an
introduction to building contracts using Blockly.
* If you are not a Haskell programmer, then you can skip the tutorial
sections on link:./tutorial-v1.3/marlowe-semantics.md[Understanding the
semantics] and link:./tutorial-v1.3/using-marlowe.md[Using Marlowe].

I have learned about Marlowe 1.3, and written contracts there, but I
want to convert to v2.0 and use the Marlowe Playground.

* You can find out about the
link:./tutorial-v1.3/differences.md[differences between v1.3 and v2.0],
and link:./tutorial-v1.3/checklist.md[this checklist] will help you to
convert contracts from v1.3 to v2.0.

I am a Haskell programmer, and I want to get started developing Marlowe
contracts embedded in Haskell and to run them in Haskell and the Marlowe
Playground.

* To do this, follow the link:./tutorial-v2.0/README.md[tutorial] on the
current version of Marlowe and develop your programs in the
https://prod.meadow.marlowe.iohkdev.io[Marlowe Playground].
