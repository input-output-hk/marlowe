chapter "Code exports"

text \<open>This theory contains the necessary code to export a version of the Marlowe Semantics in Haskell.
\<close>

text \<open>We start by importing the theories we want to export and a translation theory. The theory \<^term>\<open>Code_Target_Numeral\<close>
 translates the default representation of numbers (which is suitable for logic reasoning) into a more performant representation.\<close>

text \<open>We export all the constants in one statement, because they don't add up, if you export two times,
the second export will overwrite the first one.\<close>

export_code
  \<comment> \<open>With the following exports, we declare that we want to have all the important semantic functions.
     Ideally, just with this we would have everything we need, but we need to force some exports.
