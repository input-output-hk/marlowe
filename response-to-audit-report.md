# Response to Audit Report for the Marlowe Specification and for Marlowe on Cardano



## Executive Summary

Marlowe is a domain-specific language (DSL) for multi-party financial contracts. Operational semantics are formalized in the Isabelle proof-assistant and an interpreter for Marlowe for the Cardano blockchain is provided as Plutus validator script. Early in 2023 the Marlowe specification, the on-chain implementation and the validator test-suite were audited by Tweag's High Assurance Software Group. The report is available online. It categorizes findings of either high, medium or low severity. The present document summarizes the subsequent changes made to the Marlowe specification, the implementation of the validator and the property-based tests for the validator. All of the high-severity findings have been remedied or mitigated through changes to the specification, the proofs in Isabelle or the implementation. Nearly all of the medium-severity and low-severity findings have also been addressed, otherwise justification for not addressing a finding has been provided.

The high-severity findings comprise handling of negative deposits, prevention of "double satisfaction", enforcement of state invariants, an implementation difference between the formal specification versus the Plutus implementation and the proof of money preservation in Isabelle. The Marlowe validator has been altered to resolve these first three findings so that it correctly prevents negative deposits from altering the balance of internal accounts, it only allows other Plutus scripts to run during transactions that do not make Marlowe payments and it rigorously enforces invariants for initial and final states. The fourth finding regarding the Plutus implementation was mitigated via code analysis and property-based testing. The fifth finding about the proof of the money preservation theorem was remedied by revising the Isabelle code.

The medium-severity findings typically suggested improvements to the Isabelle proofs, addition of more extensive property-based testing, correction of infelicities in the implementation, or safe-coding improvements. The low-severity findings generally centered on the usefulness of code comments, naming of variable bindings, omissions in specifications and correction of typographical errors. All of the findings that affect the clarity of the specifications, the coverage of testing, or the robustness of implementation were made. Numerous additional property-based tests were added to the test suite as a result of the audit findings.

The changes outlined here have not been re-audited. The alterations to the Marlowe validator (detailed in the Appendix) have been kept to the minimum needed to address exclusively the audit findings.

Finally, please note that the scope of the audit included the Marlowe language and interpreter, but not individual Marlowe contracts or off-chain code. Although the Marlowe language and its implementation on Cardano aim to make smart contracts safer, it is nevertheless still possible to design individual instances of Marlowe contracts that exhibit unwanted behavior. Such undesirable behavior may result either from poor contract design or lack of testing and analysis of the contract. [A best-practices guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/best-practices.md) and [a security guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/security.md) provide advice for the safe and secure design and testing of individual Marlowe contracts, which can themselves be subject to audit or certification.


## Acknowledgement

We thank the High Assurance Software Group at Tweag for their diligent and expert analyses of the Marlowe specifications, proofs, implementations and tests and their clear and thorough communication of their findings.


## Overview of Isabelle Changes

The audit report's main and high-severity concerns for the Isabelle Proofs were:

- 2.1.6 Missing description of Merkleization
- 2.1.4 Inaccurate formulation of Money preservation

We did not mention merkleization in the specification document as it was considered an implementation detail. This does lessen the applicability of the Isabelle proofs to the different implementations (Marlowe on Cardano, Marlowe in PureScript, etc). To check that an implementation is compliant with the specification we use the `spec-test` tool, which uses property based tests to check that a custom implementation behaves equally to the Isabelle implementation. Without the proper formalization, the tool can only test for the non-merkleized cases. In practice this gives us confidence that the merkleized interpreter works the same for non-merkleized cases. To test the correctness of merkleized cases, the marlowe-cardano repository has specific tests. The formalization of merkleization will be introduced in a future version of the specification (initial work started in [PR-171](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/171)).

The Money preservation theory had only taken into account the amount of assets and not the type. This meant that the proof was not considering a case where a contract could receive `20 ada`, `15 djed` and pay back `20 djed` and `15 ada`. We added a new `MultiAssets` type and refactored the Isabelle code (without modifying the interpreter) to prove that the Assets are preserved.

Other medium and low priorities findings regarding documentation and legibility of the specification were also addressed.


## Overview of Changes to Marlowe-Cardano Specification and Haskell (Plutus) Implementation

The audit report's main and high-severity concerns for the Plutus validators for Marlowe on Cardano fell into four clusters:

1. Incorrect handling of negative deposits
    - "2.1.1 Negative deposits allow stealing funds"
2. Incomplete prevention of double satisfaction
    - "2.1.2 Contracts vulnerable to double satisfaction attacks"
3. Lax enforcement of invariants in Marlowe state
    - "2.1.7 Positive balances are not checked for the output state"
    - "2.1.8 Non-validated Marlowe states"
    - "2.1.9 Total balance of ending state uncomputed"
    - "2.1.10 Unchecked ending balance"
4. Difference semantics of association lists in Isabelle and Plutus
    - "2.1.12 Different insertion functions used in Isabelle and Haskell code"

Incorrect handling of negative deposits (item 1 above) was mitigated by the addition of a guard against this behavior in Marlowe's Plutus validator so that its behavior is consistent with Marlowe semantics. Property-based tests were also added to check the correctness of the mitigation.

Although the Marlowe validator had prevented double-satisfaction among multiple copies of the Marlowe validator script running in the same transaction, it did not prevent double-satisfaction in cases where the Marlowe validator ran alongside another Plutus validator in the same transaction (item 2 above). Double satisfaction is now prevented by enforcing that the Marlowe validator is the only Plutus script that runs during transactions that make payments to parties. This allows Marlowe contracts to coordinate with other Plutus scripts, but only under conditions where double satisfaction is impossible. Once again, property-based tests were added to check the correctness of this mitigation.

The Marlowe validator had made optimistic assumptions about its own correct operation and hence did not check certain invariants in order to reduce Plutus execution costs (item 3 above). The Marlowe semantics validator has now been thoroughly hardened against corruption of initial or final state so that it ensures that the three state-invariants of positive accounts, non-duplication of state entries (accounts, choices, and bound values), and a total internal value matching the script UTxO's value. This hardening was completed without unduly increasing the size (in bytes) of the validator or its Plutus execution cost: such was verified with simulated and on-chain measurement of execution costs for a library of real-life Marlowe contracts. Notably, the enforcement of the final invariants protects against funds becoming permanently locked in a Marlowe contract due to a garbled state: even in cases where the implementation of Marlowe semantics or parts of the Plutus validator were flawed, at least some of the execution paths of a Marlowe contract might remain viable, so funds could be released even under nominally impossible but catastrophic difficulties. The property-based test suite was significantly enhanced to check double-satisfaction situations.

Mitigation of the difference between association lists (item 4 above) in Isabelle (`MList`) and Plutus (`AssocMap`) was handled by the aforementioned enforcement of invariants, by line-by-line code inspection and annotation, and by thoroughly enhanced property-based testing. Work is in progress on a formal proof of the equivalence of `MList` and `AssocMap` under pre-conditions that hold within Marlowe semantics. Note that porting Isabelle's `MList` implementation to Plutus would have enlarged the Marlowe semantics validator by at least 2000 bytes and rendered it too costly to execute within the Cardano ledger's present execution-cost limits.

The audit report for Marlowe on Cardano was based on the commit hash [523f3d56](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/523f3d56f22bf992ddb0b0c8a52bb7a5a188f9e9). The revisions and mitigations discussed here apply to [ac65eba1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/) of that repository. The appendix to this report list the differences between pre- and post-audit validator code for Marlowe on Cardano.

The medium-severity concerns in the audit report center around missing tests or name shadowing. These have all been remedied either by code changes (in the case of the shadowing) or by the implementation of a significant augmentation of the property-based test suite. The audit's low-severity concerns generally relate to insufficiently detailed text in the Marlowe Cardano specification, the need for more elaborate comments in the code, naming of variable bindings, or typographical errors. Nearly all of these finds have been addressed, with only the exception of a few cosmetic recommendations that were not adopted.


# 2 Responses to Specific Findings


## 2.1 Main concerns


### 2.1.1 Negative deposits allow stealing funds *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 6`**
>
> The income from deposits is computed by adding up the deposit inputs, regardless of whether they are negative, while the semantics considers them as zero deposits. Combined with the absence of a balance check on the ending Marlowe state, this allows the ending balance to differ from the value paid to the Marlowe validator.
>
> This disagreement can be exploited to steal money from a flawed Marlowe contract that allows a negative deposit. The issue is demonstrated in […].

This vulnerability was mitigated in commit [68791fac](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/68791facc195068717cbc6e55d1e4fdbe1f4a521) by adding a guard against negative deposits in the Marlowe semantics validator. That guard ensures that the validator's semantics for negative deposits matches Marlowe's Isabelle semantics: namely a deposit of a negative quantity is treated as a deposit of zero. Thus a negative deposit will not decrement any of the account balances in the Plutus datum and the total of the internal balances will match the value held in the UTxO output to the Marlowe semantics script address.

A new golden test for negative deposits was added in commit [bbb9b8fc](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/bbb9b8fc21ad93b7bcdb3b60be0f2f9c921f6bec) and property-based tests for negative deposits were added in commits [bbb9b8fc](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/bbb9b8fc21ad93b7bcdb3b60be0f2f9c921f6bec), [9d5443c5](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/9d5443c5e9306eaf49ac5389df455e07555c9e04), [4b81ee96](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/4b81ee96b1e7c74c4964cf25f6bb599c80d07a52), and [15446073](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/15446073131c4098fed781cdcc701b89b77f6bd0).


### 2.1.2 Contracts vulnerable to double satisfaction attacks *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 15`**
>
> No datum is required for outputs fulfilling payments to addresses generated by the evaluation of a Marlowe contract. This implies that these outputs are vulnerable to double satisfaction in transactions involving other contracts that pay to the same wallets. An example is discussed in […].
>
> One way to strengthen the implementation is for the Marlowe validator to demand that outputs paid to addresses contain a datum that identifies the contract instance, like the `TxOutRef` of the validator UTxO being spent. Then cooperation with other contracts is possible without double satisfaction if the validators of the other contracts demand a different datum for their outputs.

The Marlowe semantics validator had prevented a limited form of double-satisfaction attack by preventing two Marlowe validators to execute in the same transaction. The audit report correctly highlights that such an attack could be feasible in cases where another Plutus validator (not the selfsame version of the Marlowe semantics validator) executes in a transactions where a payment to an address or to the Marlowe role-payout validator satisfies both the Marlowe semantics validator and the other validator.

Although the audit report's suggestion of including a unique datum for each payment (such as that identifying the contract instance) in any output payment from the contract would likely prevent double satisfaction, implementing such a change in the Marlowe validators would have entailed such extensive changes to the specification and implementation that the overall applicability of the audit findings might subsequently be called into question. Instead, a minimal change to the specification and implementation mitigates this vulnerability: the specification was amended with a "Constraint 20. Single satisfaction" that requires the Marlowe semantics validator be the only Plutus script running in the transaction *if payments to parties are being made in the transaction*. Thus, only allowing one script to validate in case of external payments completely eliminates the possibility that one payment would satisfy two scripts. Other contracts are permitted to cooperate with Marlowe in cases such as deposits, choices, and notifications where Marlowe is not making payments.

### 2.1.3 Missing constructor in equality instance *(Severity: High)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Class instance `Eq ReduceWarning`, line *845***
>
> The constructor `ReduceAssertionFailed` is not mentioned and compares `False` against itself. This might cause validators to fail checking the presence of this particular warning.

Although this `Eq` instance is not used by the Marlowe validators (so it does not have implications for validator security), the equality test has been fixed because it is a liability for off-chain code and for potential future versions of validators that might perform such an equality test. Commit [84d65a70](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/84d65a70c29320fab501ad759bbc71855d1b63fc) fixes this and commit [04805a39](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/04805a393c0815fe0f2a1a6d7f76d9867ffe0c14) hardens all of the other `Eq` instances to prevent similar problems re-arising if sum types are augmented in the future.


### 2.1.4 Inaccurate formulation of Money preservation *(Severity: High)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.1 Money preservation`, page *29***
>
> As the property stands, it is permitted to make deposits in one currency and return payments in a different currency. As long as the sums of the amounts match, the equality is satisfied. Yet it is unlikely that the participants of the contract would agree that money has been preserved.
>
> Money preservation is a property stated with an equality. The left hand side is the sum of the deposits done by a list of transactions. The right hand side of the equality is the sum of all the payments done in the same list of transactions. Each sum, in turn, is represented as a single integer which aggregates the amounts of the various payments and deposits, irrespective of what currencies correspond to these amounts.

To address this, a new `MultiAssets.thy` Isabelle theory was created. This theory defines a new type that ties together the number of tokens and the type of token, and it implements some type classes to be able to work with normal addition and subtraction. Also, the `MoneyPreservation` was refactored into `AssetsPreservation`, addressing issue 2.1.4 among others.

These changes can be found in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161)


### 2.1.5 Insufficient documentation of Money preservation *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.1 Money preservation`, page *29***
>
> Money preservation is formulated in terms of functions that are not discussed in the specification. It is necessary to explain the meaning of these functions in sufficient detail so readers can understand the property.

The theory was completely refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161), adding the necessary documentation.


### 2.1.6 Missing description of Merkleization *(Severity: High)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, `Merkleization`**
>
> There is no property about merkleization, but merkleization is implemented in the Cardano integration.
>
> Some relevant properties could be:
>
> 1.  The merkleized contract produces the same payments as the analogous regular contract.
> 2.  If a merkleized case input is applied successfully, it implies that the contract hash in the input corresponds to the continuation of the contract.
> 3.  Merkleizing and unmerkleizing a contract gives back the original contract.

We did not mention the merkleization in the specification document as it was considered an implementation detail. This does lessen the applicability of the Isabelle proofs to the different implementations (Marlowe on Cardano, Marlowe on PureScript, etc). To check that an implementation is compliant to the specification we use the `spec-test` tool, which uses property based tests to check that a custom implementation behaves equally to the Isabelle implementation. Without the proper formalization, the tool can only test for the non-merkleized cases. In practice this gives us confidence that the merkleized interpreter works the same for non-merkleized cases. To test the correctness of merkleized cases, the marlowe-cardano repository has specific tests.

The Merkleization formalization will be introduced in a future version of the specification, the initial formulation started in [PR-171](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/171).


### 2.1.7 Positive balances are not checked for the output state *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 13`**
>
> *Positive balances* are only checked for the input, not for the output Marlowe state. If the semantics are flawed, a transaction can produce an unspendable output that does not satisfy this constraint.
>
> If such a transaction is accepted, no further evaluation will be possible since all subsequent transactions will be rejected due to the very same Constraint 13. This is an hypothetical attack vector, where a malicious actor could send a transaction to block a contract.

The Plutus code for the Marlowe semantics validator had been implemented with the optimistic assumption that semantics would not be flawed and that the additional execution cost of checking the output state was not warranted. However, as the audit report points out, such a flaw would result in the contract being forever blocked from further execution. Adding a check on the final output's validity now prevents a contract from ever reaching a fully blocked state. Even if the semantics or Plutus code were flawed, at least some execution paths in the contract might remain viable, so that the contract could eventually terminate and would not permanently lock funds.

Commits [0a890845](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/0a890845c44ccfe4df97e765e9b9eb743ce7d580), [8855feae](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8855feae473882b82643db792327423152e45b5c), [26f024e8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/26f024e80cea0dd4ebf8bff0f1a10b97aea87894), and [201c5df9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/201c5df9de29b3b142be5ff7d0a9b56d1b378204) augment the Marlowe Cardano specification to require positive balances upon output and implements the corresponding check in the Marlowe Semantics validator. Commit [d514bcd0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d514bcd075732b07e1c6a73e2e3c68afa01acf2c), [7f562545](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/7f562545d013dd17472b692b550ffdc7f8a383f3), and [ebab31d9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/ebab31d9ba6dd322d374b34cad3995050a0e476e) adds a property-based test for this.


### 2.1.8 Non-validated Marlowe states *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Missing constraint`**
>
> The validator is not specified to check that the Marlowe states in the input and output datums are valid. This condition is necessary for the lemmas about the Marlowe semantics to be applicable. The Marlowe state could become invalid if there is a flaw in the implementation of the semantics.
>
> It also could be possible for the Marlowe state to be invalid if someone pays an output to the Marlowe validator with an invalid Marlowe state. Though this problem could be addressed with off-chain checks that prevent sending transactions that spend outputs with invalid Marlowe states. If off-chain checks are used, a note in the specification about how this is handled would be helpful.
>
> An example showing betrayed user expectations is discussed in […].
>
> For a valid Marlowe state, the association lists for bound values, accounts, and choices have keys sorted and without duplicates.

Prompted by this finding in the audit report, the Marlowe semantics validator has been altered to enforce all invariants (positive accounts; non-duplication of accounts, choices, and bound values; a total internal account balance that exactly matches the value in the script's UTxO) on both the initial and final states. This prevents execution of a Marlowe contract that was inadvertently or purposefully created by off-chain code with an invalid initial state. It also prevents transactions that corrupt the final state; such corruption could only happen if there were a flaw in the Plutus validator or Marlowe semantics implementation, in which case that particular execution-path of the contract would be blocked. The [Marlowe Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/best-practices.md) and [Marlowe Security Guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/security.md) warn of the importance of off-chain code creating valid initial state for Marlowe contracts.

Commits [0a890845](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/0a890845c44ccfe4df97e765e9b9eb743ce7d580), [8855feae](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8855feae473882b82643db792327423152e45b5c), [26f024e8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/26f024e80cea0dd4ebf8bff0f1a10b97aea87894), and [201c5df9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/201c5df9de29b3b142be5ff7d0a9b56d1b378204) enforce that both the initial and final states in the respective incoming and outgoing datum obey the aforementioned three invariants of total value, non-duplication, and positivity. That commit also adds "Constraint 19. No duplicates" to the Marlowe Cardano specification. Property-based tests in commit [d514bcd0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d514bcd075732b07e1c6a73e2e3c68afa01acf2c), [7f562545](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/7f562545d013dd17472b692b550ffdc7f8a383f3), and [ebab31d9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/ebab31d9ba6dd322d374b34cad3995050a0e476e) check the implementation.


### 2.1.9 Total balance of ending state uncomputed *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 6`**
>
> The constraint says
>
> > The beginning balance plus the deposits equals the ending balance plus the payments.
>
> However, the Marlowe validator never computes the total balance of the accounts in the ending Marlowe state. Instead, the ending balance is assumed to be whatever value is paid by the transaction to the Marlowe validator. The natural language should describe precisely what is being checked.

The mitigation of the previous audit-report finding ("2.1.8 Non-validated Marlowe states") also mitigates this finding: in the validator, `checkOwnOutputConstraint marloweData finalBalance` ensures that the computed final balance of accounts matches the value output to the script's UTxO and `checkState "o" finalBalance txOutState` ensures that it matches the sum of value in the internal accounts.

Again as previously, the relevant commits are [0a890845](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/0a890845c44ccfe4df97e765e9b9eb743ce7d580), [8855feae](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8855feae473882b82643db792327423152e45b5c), [26f024e8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/26f024e80cea0dd4ebf8bff0f1a10b97aea87894), and [201c5df9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/201c5df9de29b3b142be5ff7d0a9b56d1b378204) for specification and implementation and [d514bcd0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d514bcd075732b07e1c6a73e2e3c68afa01acf2c), [7f562545](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/7f562545d013dd17472b692b550ffdc7f8a383f3), and [ebab31d9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/ebab31d9ba6dd322d374b34cad3995050a0e476e) for property-based tests.


### 2.1.10 Unchecked ending balance *(Severity: High)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 5`**
>
> The balance of the starting Marlowe state is checked to match the value in the input. However, the validator does not check that the ending balance matches the value in the output paid to the Marlowe validator. Similarly to Issue […], if there are flaws in the semantics that cause the ending balance to differ from the actual value paid to the validator, this constraint would prevent any transaction from spending the output.
>
> The specification should at least discuss why the check is absent together with the other similar checks that are not implemented (checking that ending accounts have positive balances, checking that the ending Marlowe state is valid).

As the audit report recognizes, this concern is closely related to the three previous concerns. The revised validator's enforcement of the three invariants for the final state ensures that the ending balance of the internal accounts in the state matches the actual output paid to the script.

Again as previously, the relevant commits are [0a890845](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/0a890845c44ccfe4df97e765e9b9eb743ce7d580), [8855feae](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8855feae473882b82643db792327423152e45b5c), [26f024e8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/26f024e80cea0dd4ebf8bff0f1a10b97aea87894), and [201c5df9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/201c5df9de29b3b142be5ff7d0a9b56d1b378204) for specification and implementation and [d514bcd0](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d514bcd075732b07e1c6a73e2e3c68afa01acf2c), [7f562545](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/7f562545d013dd17472b692b550ffdc7f8a383f3), and [ebab31d9](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/ebab31d9ba6dd322d374b34cad3995050a0e476e) for property-based tests.

This module was refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161) and these functions were no longer needed.


### 2.1.12 Different insertion functions used in Isabelle and Haskell code *(Severity: High)*

However, the functions are not equivalent as demonstrated by the following examples: […]

The porting of `MList` from Isabelle to Plutus would have increased the size and execution cost of the Marlowe semantics validator beyond the present limits of the Cardano ledger. Work is underway to modify the Isabelle semantics and proofs to make obvious that no assumptions about the implementation of association maps are made. Instead of modifying the Marlowe semantics validator to address this finding, all usages of `AssocMap` were manually reviewed to verify that no vulnerability was introduced by its use (as compared to `MList`) *provided that the precondition of no duplicate entries in the `AssocMap` held*: the source code was annotated with informal reasoning documenting the safety of `AssocMap`'s use. That manual review was augmented by a comprehensive set of property-based tests to check the behavior of `MList` (under the precondition that it was ordered and contained no duplicates) against `AssocMap` (under the precondition that it contained not duplicates) for all functions used in Marlowe semantics or in the Marlowe validator.

Commit [a2ff6aa3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/a2ff6aa334efb7b7955408d29cf0e2edf06bca08) annotates the Marlowe semantics validator with reasoning as to the safe use of `AssocMap`. Commits [af380a29](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/af380a292c0369bcc77d8584d81ea80a31326b61), [e2277677](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/e2277677987f359dcd8754275eccd5b7c9a880a7), [a95a616a](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/a95a616aca59bc7159d3ffa92487f8f021820bff), [b65ccfec](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/b65ccfec3708484ff52514671e0e227c13f084f3), and [9e068b6a](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/9e068b6a60103f2a40604a7eaea57c5f29b59180) implement the property-based tests for the behavior of the Plutus `AssocMap` against the Isabelle `MList`.


### 2.1.13 Missing specification tests *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Spec/Marlowe/Semantics/Compute.hs`**
>
> There are no tests for the properties in Section 3 of `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`. Besides checking that there are no translation mistakes, these properties would also help contrasting the assumptions in the Isabelle and the Haskell sides, like the meaning of validity of an association list, which is focused in the previous issue.

Subsequent to the commencement of the audit, a "test oracle" (called `test-spec`) was developed that checks implementations of Marlowe semantics (such as the Plutus validator) against a reference implementation generated directly from the Isabelle specification. That generated Haskell implementation is backed by Isabelle proofs of the correctness of Haskell code generation by Isabelle. The test oracle is now applied to the Marlowe semantics implementation in Plutus that the validator use. The test oracle uses the reference implementation to generate test cases to challenge the Plutus implementation and then it checks the Plutus result against its own result. This oracle provides sufficient coverage to address this audit-reports concern regarding the lack of property-based tests for Section 3 of the Marlowe specification.


## 2.2 Marlowe specification


### 2.2.1 Lack of explanation regarding changing choices *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.4 Choices`, page *10***
>
> Choices can only be changed when evaluating `When` statements. This is something only evident after looking at the implementation of `computeTransaction`. It needs to be discussed when first introducing choices and the `When` contract.

We improved documentation regarding choices in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168) and [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.2 Undefined reference *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.7 Contracts`, page *13***
>
> There is an undefined reference.

We fixed this in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.3 Lack of explanation for necessity of `Environment` type *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
>
> An `Environment` type is introduced, but it is unclear why it is needed as it is defined as a synonym for time intervals.

We added more documentation regarding the environment in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.4 Unclear meaning of execution environment *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
>
> The meaning of the execution environment of the transaction is unclear. This is due to the concept of *transaction* being assumed by the specification and never formally introduced.
>
> The specification reads
>
> > The execution environment of a Marlowe contract simply consists of the (inclusive) time interval within which the transaction is occurring.
>
> One has to infer that evaluating a Marlowe contract is undefined if it does not happen within a transaction, as otherwise the description of the execution environment would not make sense. It would be necessary to establish more explicitly the relationship between the contract evaluation and the notion of transaction.

We added more documentation regarding the execution environment in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.5 Unexplained interval data types *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.1.8 State and Environment`, page *14***
>
> The meaning of the data types `IntervalError` and `IntervalResult` needs to be explained.

These types were properly documented in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.6 Incomplete explanation for `TransactionOutput` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.1 Compute Transaction`, page *15***
>
> The meaning of the data type `TransactionOutput` needs to be explained. More generally, the meaning of the return types of most functions has to be explained. Currently, the meaning can only be inferred from looking at how the types are used, which makes it harder to identify if they are used as intended.
>
> The purpose of these types needs to be made explicit so it can be checked if the code is doing what is intended.

This type was properly documented in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.7 Code snippets switch languages *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.1 Compute Transaction`, page *15***
>
> The specification changes from using Isabelle to using Haskell henceforth. Making the reader aware of the criteria for the language change would help maintaining the document.

The cause of this problem was that initially we had the Isabelle code separated from the documentation generation and we could not find a way to display the Isabelle code, so we showed the exported Haskell instead. We agree that it is confusing so we refactored to a literate programming style in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.8 Repeated definition of `IntervalResult` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Sections `2.1.8 State and Environment, 2.2.2 Fix Interval`, pages *14, 16***
>
> The `IntervalResult` type is defined twice in the specification. One should be removed.

We removed the extra definition in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.2.9 Poorly named variable `newAccount` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.6 Reduce Contract Step`, page *19***
>
> In the implementation of the function `reduceContractStep`, the variable `newAccount` should be named `newAccounts`.

We renamed as suggested in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.10 Poorly named variable `acc` in specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.8 Apply Cases`, page *22***
>
> On the last equation of `applyCases`, `acc` should be named `input`.

We renamed as suggested in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).

This function is confusing, we will likely remove it in a future release.


### 2.2.12 Redundant evaluation in `addMoneyToAccount` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.9 Utilities`, page *22***
>
> `addMoneyToAccount` is redundantly evaluating `money <= 0` when invoking `updateMoneyInAccount`. The else branch could be replaced instead with `insert (accId, token) money accountsV`.

We disagree with this observation. The function `updateMoneyInAccount` checks if its money parameter is non-positive, so as to always have accounts with positive balance. The
`addMoneyToAccount` function calls `updateMoneyInAccount` with `balance + money` and checks that `money` is positive. This ensures that `addMoneyToAccount` always increases the assets.


### 2.2.13 Redundant statement regarding addition *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, page *24***
>
> It says that addition is associative and commutative. This is true but it is already implied by the equation preceding the statement. Maybe change to

The statement was removed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.2.14 Missing implementation for negation case of `evalValue` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, page *24***
>
> Negation for `evalValue` does not show the implementation, just one lemma about `NegValue`, which is inconsistent with how other operations are presented.

The way we document `evalValue` was modified in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.15 Missing parentheses in `div` specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, page *25***
>
> On page 25 formula $$c \neq 0 \Rightarrow c \mathbin{∗} a \mathbin{\mathrm{div}} (c \mathbin{∗} b) = a \mathbin{\mathrm{div}} b$$ needs additional parentheses around the term $c \mathbin{∗} a$, otherwise it can be parsed as $$c \neq 0 \Rightarrow c \mathbin{∗} (a \mathbin{\mathrm{div}} (c \mathbin{∗} b)) = a \mathbin{\mathrm{div}} b$$ which does not hold (Counter-example: $c=2, a=3, b=2$). The lemma `divMultiply` in the file `Semantics.thy` does use extra parentheses around $c \mathbin{∗} a$.

This lemma was removed from the specification and replaced with lemmas that use `evalValue` instead.


### 2.2.16 Unclear division explanation *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, page *25***
>
> It says
>
> > Division is a special case because we only evaluate to natural numbers.

This was corrected to use `integer` instead of `natural` and further rephrased in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.17 Discrepancy with `evalValue` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, pages *23--26***
>
> The order of some cases for `evalValue` is different in the specification text and in the actual Isabelle code, and several cases (for example, `NegValue`) are missing from the specification entirely.
>
> Moreover, the definition of `evalValue` is juxtaposed with some lemmas about its behavior (for example, `AddValue` being associative and commutative), making it harder to match the specification text with the Isabelle code.

The way we document `evalValue` was modified in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.18 Missing `evalValue` lemmas in specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, pages *23--26***
>
> Not all lemmas about `evalValue` are listed in the specification. The absent lemmas include `evalDoubleNegValue`, `evalMulValue`, `evalSubValue`, and all division lemmas.

This section was rewritten and only the Division lemmas are now present, as they are the most relevant ones.


### 2.2.19 Typo in **Use Value** case of `evalValue` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2.2.10 Evaluate Value`, page *26***
>
> The **Use Value** case mentions `TimeIntervalEnd` instead of `UseValue`.

This section was [rewritten](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182) and the issue was fixed.


### 2.2.20 Unexplained parameters of `playTrace` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3 Marlowe Guarantees`, page *28***
>
> The parameters of the function `playTrace` need to be explained.

The function `playTrace` was documented in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182) in section 2.2.7.


### 2.2.21 Type parameter discrepancy in `playTrace` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3 Marlowe Guarantees`, page *28***
>
> The first parameter of `playTrace` in the specification is `int`, while it is `POSIXTime` in the code. Even though the latter is an alias for the former, it is beneficial to use the `POSIXTime` name both for consistency and readability.

This happened because we were using a type alias, which gets fully expanded when being referenced by the documentation. [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182) addresses this by making the whole theory in literate programming mode.


### 2.2.22 Money preservation on failing transactions not specified *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.1 Money preservation`, page *29***
>
> Money preservation is expressed with an equality. This equality, however, only ensures money preservation for those lists of transactions that produce no error. In other words, there is no guarantee that money will be preserved for those lists of transactions that fail.
>
> This is not a concern in practice because the lists of transactions that fail to evaluate are not accepted in the blockchain. However, this should be made explicit in the explanation of the property.

This was taken into account in the new Asset preservation theory and a [paragraph](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161/files#diff-060b0c9f7bde4e9ebc4e7b9d6a2202af75213be8d44d7f4745e02054be5186deR52-R53) was added to explain the case.


### 2.2.23 Complicated definition of `allAccountsPositive` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.3 Positive Accounts`, page *30***
>
> The definition of\ `allAccountsPositive` is complicated and can be refactored as `all ((_, money) -> money > 0)`.

The proposed definition is simpler and it is likely to be implemented in the future.


### 2.2.24 Discrepancy with Isabelle code for `allAccountsPositive` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Sections `3.3 Positive Accounts`, page *30***
>
> The `allAccountsPositive` function is defined differently in the specification and in the Isabelle code, although both definitions show the same behavior. These definitions need to be consolidated.

The definition in the specification is the exported Haskell code of the Isabelle code. This is a limitation that Isabelle has when importing code from other theories. A possible solution is to change the Accounts positive theory to be literal programming.


### 2.2.25 Misleading or incorrect formula for contract not holding funds *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.6.3 Contract Does Not Hold Funds After it Closes`, page *32***
>
> The statement in natural language looks unconnected from the proposed formula. Otherwise, it is unclear how not holding funds forever is a consequence of producing no warnings.

The statement was indeed unconnected from the description. In [PR-186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/186) we refactored the guarantees section and now the section "3.2 Finite contracts"
includes the theorem `timedOutTransaction_closes_contract` which shows that after closing a timed-out contract, the accounts are emptied.


### 2.2.26 Different format for lemma statement *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Sections `3.6.2 All Contracts Have a Maximum Time`, page *32***
>
> The lemma is stated using the proof derivation tree format as opposed to the rest of the specification and the Isabelle code.

This was addressed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.2.27 Function `isClosedAndEmpty` is unexplained *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `3.6.2 All Contracts Have a Maximum Time`, page *32***
>
> The function `isClosedAndEmpty` needs to be explained.

In [PR-186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/186) we added a small explanation; in the future, we will probably expand on this by refactoring the guarantees as literate programming.


### 2.2.28 Top-down definitions *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Section `2`**
>
> In Section 2, the order of definitions is reversed, and the reader is thus faced with functions which call other functions that have not been introduced yet, despite the claim in Section 1.3 that the definitions will be presented bottom-up.

This section was redone in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.2.29 No mention of Isabelle lemmas in specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, Multiple sections ``**
>
> Generally, readability can be improved by mentioning the Isabelle lemma names alongside their statements. This way, it would be much easier to search for the actual Isabelle code and proofs matching the informal specification text, and compare the two.

In [PR-186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/186) we added the names of the theories in the specification.


## 2.3 Lemmas and proofs


### 2.3.1 Unnecessarily large proofs *(Severity: Medium)*

We agree with this observation. New lemmas and theories are proven with this recommendation in mind, and some theories were refactored (like the Asset preservation). It will take some time until all theories are in this format.


### 2.3.2 Long lines in lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
>
> Lines are sometimes long which makes it difficult to understand the lemmas. Lemmas need to be formulated expressing one hypothesis per line and the conclusion on a separate line. Complex hypotheses need to be indented using several lines to expose their structure.

We agree with this observation. New lemmas and theories are proven with this recommendation in mind, and some theories were refactored (like the Asset preservation). It will take some time until all theories are in this format.


### 2.3.3 Confusing auxiliary lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
>
> Some Isabelle proofs resort to declaring auxiliary lemmas with names suffixed with *\_aux*. Sometimes these lemmas are not expressed succinctly, and look more like a punctual copy of the state of some particular proof that is later developed. For the sake of maintaining the proofs, it would be necessary to structure them in a way that presents the information piecewise to the reader. More generally, even auxiliary lemmas should have a well-defined meaning.
>

> -   in `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, lemma `applyAllInputsPrefix_aux`

We agree with this observation. New lemmas and theories are proven with this recommendation in mind, and some theories were refactored (like the Asset preservation). It will take some time until all theories are in this format.


### 2.3.4 Undescriptive variable names *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**
>
> Many Isabelle proof statements and proofs use uninformative variable names. The most common example occurs with variables named $\mathit{x11}, \mathit{x12}$, etc. These inhibit the reader from easily understanding the lemma statements, and often require looking back at constructors to understand what these variables represent.

We agree with this observation. New lemmas and theories are proven with this recommendation in mind, and some theories were refactored (like the Asset preservation). It will take some time until all theories are in this format.


### 2.3.5 Involved proof of `insert_valid` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MList.thy`, theorem `insert_valid`, line *66***
>

We agree that the proposed proof is easier, but the lemma will become obsolete once we replace the custom `MList` with
`HOL-Library/finiteMap`, which addresses other problems found in the report.


### 2.3.6 Repeated verbose expression *(Severity: Low)*

The `MoneyPreservation` was refactored into Asset preservation and now there is a single reference to `giveMoney`. As mentioned in observation 2.2.11, `giveMoney` is likely to be removed in the future.


### 2.3.7 Inconsistent variable name `valTrans` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemma `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves_aux`, line *257***

> The lemma uses a variable `valTrans` where other proofs use the name `paidMoney`. To convey the meaning of the variable faster, the same name should be used consistently in all places.

This theory was refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161) and the lemma was no longer needed.


### 2.3.8 Unused binding `interAccs` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemma `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves_aux`, line *263***

> The binding `interAccs` was probably intended to be used on this line. It should either be used or removed from the premise.

This theory was refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161) and the lemma was no longer needed.


### 2.3.9 Undescriptive variable name `acc` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemma `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves`, line *295***
>
> This lemma has a variable `acc` that is used together with `tok2`. It would be more descriptive to call it `accId2`.

This theory was refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161) and the lemma was no longer needed.


### 2.3.10 Misleading indentation *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemmas `reductionLoop_preserves_money_NoPayment_not_ReduceNoWarning, reductionLoop_preserves_money_NoPayment`, lines *430, 439***

> The indentation is misleading: the premises on these lines are indented as if they are a part of the previous functional premise.

This theory was refactored in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161) and the lemma was no longer needed.


### 2.3.11 Missing theorem regarding `playTrace` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `PositiveAccounts.thy`, `playTrace preserves valid and positive state`**
>
> There is no theorem that `playTrace` keeps the state valid and positive when given a state which is valid and positive. This trivially follows from `playTraceAux_preserves_validAndPositive_state` but no such theorem is present.

The valid and positive preservation is needed in lower-level functions so that higher-level functions can use that fact when proving other properties. This makes `playTrace` not needing that proof as it is the highest-level function. The theorem could be useful on its own and might be added in the future.


### 2.3.12 Unconcise goal in `reduceContractStepPayIsQuiescent` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `QuiescentResult.thy`, lemma `reduceContractStepPayIsQuiescent`, line *8***
>
> This lemma does not express its goal concisely, as it makes no mention of `reduceContractStep` in the formulation. Changing the first assumption to $\texttt{reduceContractStep}\ \mathit{env}\ \mathit{sta}\ (\texttt{Pay}\ \mathit{x21}\ \mathit{x22}\ \mathit{tok}\ \mathit{x23}\ \mathit{x24})$ makes more explicit in which contexts this lemma can be useful. Modifying this assumption requires an additional `apply simp` to be added to the proof (before line 30) for the lemma to go through. Further, an additional `apply simp` will need to be added in lemmas `reduceContractStepIsQuiescent` (before line 44) and `timedOutReduce_only_quiescent_in_close` (`Timeout.thy`, before line 128) as well.

We agree on this observation and it will be addressed in a future refactor of the theory file.


### 2.3.13 Misleading lemma names *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `PositiveAccounts.thy`, lemma `reduceOne_gtZero`, line *80***

>
> This lemma should be renamed as `applyAllInputs_decreases_maxTransactions` or `applyAllInputs_reduced_decreases_maxTransactions`.

We agree on these observations and they will likely be addressed when we refactor the corresponding files.


### 2.3.14 Misleading variable name `reduced` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `QuiescentResult.thy`, lemmas `reductionLoop_reduce_monotonic, reduceContractUntilQuiescent_ifDifferentReduced`, lines *138, 153***
>
> The boolean variable name `reduce` would be better named `reduced` as it is signifying that the contract has been reduced.

We agree on this observation and it will be addressed in a future refactor of the theory file.


### 2.3.15 Undescriptive name `beforeApplyAllLoopIsUseless` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, lemma `beforeApplyAllLoopIsUseless`, line *270***
>
> This lemma seems to say that `reduceContractUntilQuiescent` has no effect when composed with `applyAllLoop`, because `applyAllLoop` evaluates `reduceContractUntilQuiescent`, and `reduceContractUntilQuiescent` is idempotent.
>
> A more descriptive name for this lemma could be `reduceContractUntilQuiescent_hasNoEffect_before_applyAllLoop`

We agree on this observation and it will addressed in a future refactor of the theory file.


### 2.3.16 Unused and undocumented lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

> **Several Isabelle files, several lemmas**

>     2.  Line 13, lemma `valid_state_valid_valueBounds`
> 5.  In file `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, line 1214, lemma `traceListToSingleInput_isSingleInput`. It is mentioned in a commented out line in `StaticAnalysis.thy`. Furthermore, the lemma can be expressed more concisely as `$$\llparenthesis \mathit{interval} = \mathit{inte}, \mathit{inputs} = \mathit{inp\_h}\ \#\ \mathit{inp\_t} \rrparenthesis\ \#\ t = \mathit{traceListToSingleInput}\ \mathit{t2} % \mathrel{% \mbox{\fontfamily{cmr}\fontencoding{OT1}\selectfont=}}% \joinrel\Rightarrow\mathit{inp\_t} = []$$`

* Lemma `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves_aux` was removed in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161).
* Lemma `reduceOne_onlyIfNonEmptyState`, `valid_state_valid_choices` were removed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).
* Lemma `reduceContractUntilQuiescent_ifDifferentReduced` was promoted to a theorem with an explanation in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).
* Lemma `positiveMoneyInAccountOrNoAccount_gtZero_preservation` was removed in favor of `positiveMoneyInAccountOrNoAccount_gtZero_preservation` in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).

This lemma was removed in [PR-161](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/161).


### 2.3.18 Redundant `transferMoneyBetweenAccounts_preserves` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, lemma `reduceContractStep_preserves_money_acc_to_acc`, line *332***

Lemma `accountsArePositive` was removed in favor of `computeTransaction_gtZero` in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.3.20 Redundant `computeTransaction` lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

>
> If `computeTransaction_preserves_valid_state_aux` is rewritten to have the same formulation as `computeTransaction_preserves_valid_state`, then the lemma (with the exact same proof) is still accepted, and these lemmas become duplicates of each other. Thus, no auxiliary lemma is needed.

Lemma `computeTransaction_preserves_valid_state_aux` was removed and `computeTransaction_preserve_valid_state` simplified in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).

These issues were resolved in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168) and [PR-169](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/169)

These observations regarding readability will be addressed when we refactor the theory.

These observation regarding readability will be addressed when we refactor the theory.


### 2.3.25 Typo with "independet" in multiple lemmas *(Severity: Low)*

Readability would be improved by presenting these lemmas in the same style as the others, or documenting the need for these distinct presentations via code comments.

This observation regarding readability will be addressed when we refactor the theory.

We removed the unnecessary assumptions in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


## 2.4 Isabelle implementation


### 2.4.1 Variable shadowing in `applyAllLoop` *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `applyAllLoop`, line *575***
>
> The $\texttt{cont}$ variable introduced by the pattern match shadows another $\texttt{cont}$ variable, coming from the pattern match of an outer case expression, making the function harder to follow while also making it more error-prone to future changes.

The variable was renamed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.4.2 Undescriptive name `moneyInPayment` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `MoneyPreservation.thy`, function `moneyInPayment`, line *5***
>
> The name of the function can be more precise. Perhaps `moneyInPaymentToParty` or `moneyInExternalPayment` would work.

The theory was refactored into `AssetsPreservation` and the function is now called `assetsInExternalPayment`.


### 2.4.3 Typo in section name *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `OptBoundTimeInterval.thy`, line `37`**
>
> Typo in section name: "Interval intesection".

The typo was fixed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.4.4 Typo in comment *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `OptBoundTimeInterval.thy`, line `42`**

The typo was fixed in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168).


### 2.4.5 Unclear need for multiple formulations for positive accounts *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `PositiveAccounts.thy`, `Throughout`**
>
> It is unclear what the use is for multiple formulations (and lemmas about) positive accounts. The first formulation (with the theorems `playTraceAux_gtZero` and `playTrace_gtZero`) is not used in any other modules but the alternative formulation is used instead. If both formulations are relevant, then it should be explained why.

We agree that it is confusing, and it will be refactored in the future.


### 2.4.6 Variable name discrepancy in `reductionLoop` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `reductionLoop`**
>
> When comparing this function against `specification-v3-rc1.pdf`, different names are used for a let-bound variable. It is `a` in the pdf and `newPayments` in the file `Semantics.thy`. There are similar issues in the function `reduceContractStep` in the equation for the `If` case, and in the function `giveMoney`.

This was an artifact of showing the exported haskell code. It is resolved in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182).


### 2.4.7 Typo in constructor *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `applyCases`, line *505***

> **File `Semantics.thy`, function `calculateNonAmbiguousInterval`, line *725***
>
> The meaning of the function is not obvious. It needs a comment to explain it.

This function was documented in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168) and moved to `TimeRange.thy` in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182). The function is not part of the Marlowe spec yet: it is a helper we hope will be useful in the future to construct the transactions.


### 2.4.9 Non-modularized file `SingleInputTransactions.thy` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, `Splitting File`**
>
> This file is very long, and it covers more than just single-input transactions. For instance, about 530 lines at the beginning are rather dedicated to idempotence of certain operations.

Then there is also a clear block of lemmas about "distributivity" of semantics over transaction lists.
>
> Splitting the module, grouping the related lemmas, would help understanding the relationships between the groups.

We agree with the observation and it will be addressed in a future refactoring.


### 2.4.10 Misleading function names *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `SingleInputTransactions.thy`, function `inputsToTransactions`, line *9***
>
> This function name is not very descriptive of its meaning. It takes a transaction (both a time interval and a list of inputs) and returns a list of transactions at the same interval containing a single input each.

>
> This function should be renamed or repurposed. If renamed, `allAreSingleInput` more accurately reflects the meaning of the function. If repurposed, it should check that a single transaction has a single input, and `all isSingleInput` can be used to express the current behavior.

We agree on the observations, for the moment some simple refactoring and comments were added as part of [PR-180](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/180/files#diff-638dc578b752590b5f2bace45f1e1ae9e522351f62056e6f92aa272424657b03). Further refactoring and optional renaming might happen in the future.


### 2.4.11 Unused parameter in `maxTransactionCaseList` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `TransactionBound.thy`, function `maxTransactionCaseList`, line *16***

> This function has a parameter of type `State` that is completely unused and can be removed.

We agree on this observation and it will addressed in a future refactoring of the theory file.

> **File `TimeRange.thy`, function `isValidInterval`, line *231***
>
> This function duplicates $\texttt{validTimeInterval}$ from $\texttt{OptBoundTimeInterval.thy}$, and the latter has certain additional properties proven about it specifically, so it makes sense to use the latter in both cases.

The function `isValidInterval` was removed in favor of `validTimeInterval` in [PR-168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/168/files#diff-9c936a78b5d8eed5683713bb31c59366b2a0794c5f11e9807f7fa61d1b11b7c2L230)


## 2.5 marlowe-cardano specification


### 2.5.1 Lack of guidelines for creating cooperating contracts *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Life Cycle of a Marlowe Contract`**
>
> Given that transactions are expected to work with Marlowe and non-Marlowe contracts simultaneously, it would be helpful to offer some guidelines for other contracts to avoid double satisfaction. Some degree of cooperation between the contracts that can appear in the same transaction is unavoidable.
>
> One measure could be to ask every cooperating contract to refrain from paying to the payout validator. In this way, double satisfaction can not affect the payments of the Marlowe contract, if the Marlowe contract only pays to roles rather than addresses.
>
> Another alternative would be to demand other contracts' outputs to use datums that are different from the roles used by the Marlowe contract for payments.

Commit [00010ea4](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/00010ea48439892ff9eec54fb93929f56bcb6c7b) adds a paragraph of guidance to the Marlowe Cardano specification. The mitigation above for [2.1.2](#222-contracts-vulnerable-to-double-satisfaction-attacks-severity-high) implements validator changes to address this.


### 2.5.2 No reference to creating a minting policy *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Monetary Policy for Role Tokens`**
>
> The minting policy is not specified, but a reference needs to be offered to explain how to create one.

The monetary policy is not a concern of the Marlowe validator, but commit [fe00af7d](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/fe00af7d622bbd17c3327363d4650ee544d1fff7) adds a sentence referencing the discussion of monetary policies for role tokens in the [Marlowe Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/blob/main/marlowe/best-practices.md).


### 2.5.3 Argument for Contract in `txInfoData` not specified *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Types`**
>
> The argument by which the `Contract` in the `txInfoData` list corresponds to the given hash needs to be made explicit.

Commit [b6366efc](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/b6366efc9f8df38bfe9232f81e6caf2c7f11ffa8) makes this hash correspondence explicit in the Marlowe Cardano specification and adds a code snippet concretizing it, namely that the hash and continuation must be present in the script context datum map.


### 2.5.4 Merkleization section not detailed enough *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Merkleization`**
>
> This section is too terse. It needs to explain what Merkleization is, and to motivate why it is needed.
>
> When explaining how it works, it needs to make explicit that only the `Case` type is modified, and that in the semantics, only the `Input` type is modified. It needs to explain why the `Input` type needs to carry a hash and a contract, and why the evaluation of the contract is changed as described.

Commit [a9d40432](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/a9d4043230cb4f240fab2d816bed6a3cab4f5053) adds to the Marlowe Cardano specification a paragraph elaborating on mechanics and motivation for Merkleization, namely the ability to handle Marlowe contract that are too large to store in a datum.


### 2.5.5 Unnecessary constraint *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 12. Merkleized continuations`**
>
> This constraint is unnecessary to have in the Marlowe validator, since the construction of the arguments for evaluation of the Marlowe contract would fail. However, it would be useful to have it appear in the specification for users to be aware of it when crafting transactions. A note to motivate the presence of the constraint could be helpful.

Commit [fda1d3e8](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/fda1d3e862fc8f8c31ff479fbd338226e661eb0b) to the Marlowe Cardano specification clarifies that the constraint is supplementary (informational) in nature.


### 2.5.6 Asymmetry between role and wallet payouts *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, `Constraint 15`, **
>
> The marlowe validator allows multiple outputs to be paid to a wallet, but it demands that a single output exists when paying to a role instead. The motivation to use different approaches needs to be documented. This is implemented in `Scripts.hs` at line 371, in function `payoutConstraints`.

The asymmetry is a convenience and practicality related to the manner in which coin selection and transaction balancing typically occurs nowadays in wallets. Commit [4e81470d](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/4e81470de90ddd6858c3ad8aace96e90df5a86ae) adds to the Marlowe Cardano specification a paragraph justifying this asymmetry in payout style and a comment to the Marlowe semantics validator along the same lines.


### 2.5.7 Incorrect description of `rolePayoutValidator` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Plutus Validator for Marlowe Payouts`**
>
> The description of the Marlowe payout validator in the specification states that it is parameterized by the currency symbol. However, this is not correct as the validator is unparameterized; rather, the datum type of the validator includes the currency symbol (as well as token name). The description should be modified to reflect this.

This incorrect signature is fixed in commit [1d16de1f](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/1d16de1f1b7a167dc4eb4a057a3df2c24d0194c9).


### 2.5.8 Unspecified initial state *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Life Cycle of a Marlowe Contract`**
>
> The specification should say what the initial state of a Marlowe contract should be. In particular, creating a contract requires giving the minimum Ada to some account in the Marlowe state. Otherwise, Constraint 5 will reject the transactions that try to spend the output.

Commit [e150e308](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/e150e30867dfa5466639f46bf39656aee2888e38) details the three invariants that the initial state must satisfy: positivity of accounts, non-duplication of state entries (accounts, choices, bound values), and matching the total value in the internal state to the value of the script's UTxO.


### 2.5.9 Unspecified behavior when multiple cases can apply *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `applyCases`, line *597***
>
> If multiple cases in a case list can apply, the first one is taken. This behavior should be better communicated in the specification.

Although this behavior is required by the Isabelle specification and implemented in the Plutus validator, the comment on `applyCases` has been edited in commit [08d6f34a](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/08d6f34ac91da7aa34e7414c5bae0e33e9235d74) to reinforce that the first applicable `Case` is taken for a `When`.


## 2.6 Haskell implementation


### 2.6.1 Name shadowing in `applyAllInputs` *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `applyAllInputs`, line *658***
>
> The binding `cont` from the `Applied` constructor shadows the `cont` variable coming from the pattern match in an enclosing case expression. This makes the code error-prone to subsequent changes and refactorings.

The binding of `cont` has been renamed to `cont'` in commit [1c96edfe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/1c96edfe7e22ecc499ed75dd175490a4f2427bdc).


### 2.6.2 Non-isomorphic types in `playTraceAux` *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `playTraceAux`, line *710***
>
> The function in the Isabelle code takes a `TransactionOutputRecord` while the Haskell version takes a `TransactionOutput`. This means `TransactionError` cannot be an input to `playTraceAux` in Isabelle, possibly invalidating proofs about its properties.

The `playTrace` and `playTraceAux` functions are not used by the Marlowe validators, so no mitigation was made for this audit-report finding.


### 2.6.3 Variable names differ from Isabelle code *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Several functions**
>
> Different variable names in Isabelle and Haskell make comparison harder. It is less of an issue when only one variable has been renamed in a function, but multiple variable renames require carefully mapping between the names to avoid confusion. For example, the code of `reduceContractStep` in line 482 (`Pay` case) is hard to compare.
>
> Other name changes include:
> -   Line 456, function `updateMoneyInAccount` uses variable `money` where the Isabelle code uses `amount` and omits naming the last parameter.
> -   Line 473, function `giveMoneyToPay` uses variables `amount` and `accounts` instead of `money` and `accountsV` as in the Isabelle code.
> -   Line 541, function `reductionLoop` uses variable `con` instead of `ncontract`.
> -   Line 300, the data type `TransactionInput` corresponds to the type `Transaction` in the Isabelle code.
> -   Line 313, the data type `TransactionOutput` is isomorphic but not identical to the homonymous data type in the Isabelle code.
> -   Line 439, function `refundOne` uses a variable `balance` where the Isabelle code uses `money`.
> -   Line 463, function `addMoneyToAccount` uses variable `accounts` where the Isabelle code uses `accountsV`.

These cosmetic recommendations of the audit report have not been implemented in the Marlowe semantics validator, as the discrepancies do not strongly impact comparison.


### 2.6.4 Naming of functions and variables *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Several files`, Several functions**
>
> Several functions or variables could have more descriptive or precise names, for example:
> -   `Scripts.hs:193`: `validateBalances` could be called `allBalancesArePositive`.
> -   `Scripts.hs:206`: `validateInputs` could be called `allInputsAreAuthorized`.
> -   `Scripts.hs:324`: `checkScriptOutputAny` could be called `noOutputPaysToOwnAddress`, as it checks that *no* outputs pay to the script address.
> -   `Semantics.hs:439`: `refundOne` is named somewhat confusingly, and understanding the name requires the context of `reduceContractStep` where the function is called. Perhaps a better name would be `dropWhileNonPositiveAndUncons`.
> -   `Semantics.hs:597`: the binding `tailCase` should rather be named `tailCases`.

The aforementioned bindings `validateBalances`, `validateInputs`, and `tailCase` have been renamed to `allBalancesArePositive`, `allInputsAreAuthorized`, and `tailCases` in commit [1c96edfe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/1c96edfe7e22ecc499ed75dd175490a4f2427bdc). For historical reasons, `refundOne` has not been renamed. The function `checkScriptOutputAny` is no longer present due to other mitigations made to the validator.


### 2.6.5 Unused functions *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Several files`, Several functions**
>
> Several functions are unused and perhaps should be removed:
> -   `Semantics.hs:741`: `contractLifespanUpperBound` does not seem to be used anywhere, including tests.
> -   `Semantics.hs:680`: `isClose` is not used in the rest of the codebase (besides checking its behavior via testing). It should either be removed, or comments justifying its existence should be included.
>
> In addition to that, the functions `validateBalances` and `totalBalance` (defined at `Semantics.hs:755` and `:762`) are only used in `Scripts.hs` and never reused, so they should probably be moved to `Scripts.hs`.

Although the validator does not use these functions, off-chain code in other Haskell modules does. For the time being, the `contractLifespanUpperBound` and `isClose` have been retained in `Language.Marlowe.Core.V1.Semantics`. They will be relocated in the future if validator and non-validator code are separated into different modules.


### 2.6.6 Comments *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `refundOne`, line *439***
>
> The comment describing the function is overly concise, as it does not mention the function removing all non-positive accounts before the first positive one, and effectively `uncons`-ing the list.

Commit [ac65eba1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/ac65eba119b4eec8febc3723527edcd99914fdac) elaborates the documentation for `refundOne`.

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `addMoneyToAccount`, line *461***
>
> There is a typo in the comment: `accoun` is written instead of `account`.

Commit [1c96edfe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/1c96edfe7e22ecc499ed75dd175490a4f2427bdc) fixes this typo.


### 2.6.7 Record updates in `playTraceAux` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `playTraceAux`, line *710***
>
> The function could have followed the Isabelle code more closely if it used a record update instead of creating a new `TransactionOutput` record from scratch.

The `playTrace` and `playTraceAux` functions are not used by the Marlowe validators, so no mitigation was made for this audit-report finding.


### 2.6.8 Potential simplifications *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, Function `totalBalance`, line *755***
>
> The function uses `foldMap f . AssocMap.toList`. Here, `AssocMap.toList` is redundant.

Actually, the `PlutusTx.AssocMap.Map`'s implementation of `foldMap` does not permit this: type checking fails for this proposed change.

> **File `Types.hs`, Class instance `Eq Contract`, line *873***
>
> The equality of cases for the `When` constructor would be simplified by using `cases1 == cases2`. If there is a reason for the more verbose equality condition, it should be outlined in a comment.

A comment explaining the rationale for this equality test has been added in commit [faaae175](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/faaae1751957b4f750e3c11ffdc946de07baf0cd).


### 2.6.9 `computeTransaction` differs from the Isabelle implementation *(Severity: Low)*

> **Helper function `evalValue, evalObservation`, lines *391 (Semantics.hs), 34 (Semantics.thy)***
>
> `evalValue` and `evalObservation` differ from the Isabelle implementation in the introduction of auxiliary variables to abbreviate the recursive calls. The comparison would be simpler if both definitions were consolidated.

The Plutus implementation differs slightly from the Isabelle for efficiency and to conform to Plutus's different restrictions on recursive calls.

> **Helper function `evalValue`, lines *395 (Semantics.hs), 35 (Semantics.thy)***
>
> The Isabelle implementation should use the helper function `moneyInAccount` instead of inlining its definition, so as to maintain consistency with the Haskell implementation.

This was addressed in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182)

> **Helper function `applyCases`, lines *596 (Semantics.hs), 498 (Semantics.thy)***
>
> The structure of function `applyCases` differs between the Haskell and Isabelle files. Specifically, the Haskell implementation has an additional function `applyAction` where the Isabelle implementation does not. A comment motivating the discrepancy would be needed. This is likely due to the lack of Merkleization in the Isabelle implementation.

Commit [d0a3834a](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d0a3834ae8484bb6c7d0ecd3aeec60871b3fd165) adds a comment that the Plutus implementation differs from the Isabelle one due to the former's support for merkleization.

> **Helper function `convertReduceWarnings`, lines *617 (Semantics.hs), 537 (Semantics.thy)***
>
> The Haskell function is implemented using `foldr`, while the Isabelle function uses explicit recursion, making a one-to-one comparison less obvious. If there is a reason for this discrepancy, such as `foldr` yielding some optimizations, this should be outlined in a comment.

Commit [d1477610](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/d14776101c22eac7fbc67893020f37cbc2a9e339) adds a comment that the use of `foldr` in the Plutus implementation is for efficiency.


### 2.6.10 Constraint implementations differ from description *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Plutus Validator for Marlowe Semantics`**
>
> Some constraints mentioned in the specification are written in a different structure than the corresponding constraint in `Scripts.hs`. While such a discrepancy may be useful to minimize verbosity, a unified structure when possible would alleviate a side-by-side comparison. Examples of these differing structures include Constraint 6 and Constraint 14.

The discrepancies of implementation between the constraints in the specification and the Plutus code result from the emphasis on readability in the specification and of efficiency in the implementation. The need to minimize the validator size and execution cost in the implementation has sometimes resulted in less concise or less readable code. Note that the Plutus compiler can be quite sensitive to the precise expression of a constraint as Haskell code.


### 2.6.11 Missing argument of `computeTransaction` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Section `Relationship between Marlowe Validator and Semantics`**
>
> The specification mentions the output datum as the (fifth) argument for the `computeTransaction` function, while it is not an argument to it.

Commit [00a0c240](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/00a0c2406665f06753aecf6dbb63933edb275436) moves the comment about the non-existent fifth argument to a separate sentence following the list of arguments.


### 2.6.12 Missing `smallMarloweValidator` *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `marlowe-cardano-specification.md`, Various sections**
>
> The specification mentions `smallMarloweValidator` in a few places, but it is never mentioned in the source code.

This reference is changed to `marloweValidator` in commit [87cf548d](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/87cf548d9ae7934a702ea1a1c85d7d9bd4993aa9).


### 2.6.13 Incorrect constraint reference *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Scripts.hs`, Function `mkRolePayoutValidator`, line *150***
>
> This line should refer to Constraint 17 rather than Constraint 16.

This incorrect reference is fixed in commit [3fac0d17](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/3fac0d1749d107f13743756aa50c9723e776e391).


### 2.6.14 `MarloweParams` differs from the specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, type `MarloweParams`, line *355***
>
> The specification defines `MarloweParams` to contain just the payout validator hash, while the definition in the Haskell code contains just the roles currency symbol.

This misstatement is remedied in commit [8691f335](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8691f3351e55758cc750eee0800b1458f0a8c554).


### 2.6.15 Timeout boundary differs from the specification *(Severity: Low)*

> **File `Semantics.hs`, type `reduceContractStep`, line *518***
>
> The specification mentions
>
> > If a valid Transaction is computed with a TimeInterval with a start time bigger than the Timeout t, the contingency continuation c is evaluated.
>
> where "bigger" implies strict inequality, while the code makes non-strict comparison. This difference needs to be acknowledged and further explained in the specification.

This misstatement is remedied in [PR-182](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/pull/182)


## 2.7 Haskell tests


### 2.7.1 More precise failure checks *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Spec/Marlowe/Plutus/Specification.hs`, `Various tests`**
>
> The tests use the functions `checkSemanticsTransaction` and `checkPayoutTransaction` to verify that various error conditions cause transactions to be rejected. These functions test that a transaction passes or fails, but when it fails, the functions do not consider the error cause. Checking the exact cause is necessary to ensure the transaction is rejected because of the intended reason and not because of some other error condition arising in a particular test case by coincidence.
>
> The absence of this information makes it easier to accidentally produce a test that is not testing what is intended.

Commit [8d18385b](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/commit/8d18385b107fbce2f7a4559e6017d9e228ab958b) to the Marlowe test suite for `checkSemanticsTransaction` instruments Plutus scripts for the Marlowe validator so that the precise cause of the test failure is verified.


### 2.7.2 Missing tests *(Severity: Medium)*

> **File `Spec/Marlowe/Semantics/Compute.hs`, ``**
>
> The following properties could additionally be tested for `computeTransaction`:
> -   payment subtracts from an account,
> -   deposit adds to an account,
> -   `INotify` input produces the expected continuation,
> -   `IChoice` input produces the expected continuation,
> -   the hash of a successfully applied merkleized input matches the hash of the merkleized case.
>
> Some of these are tested in `Spec/Marlowe/Semantics/Functions.hs` already for auxiliary functions.
